    <p>This is a listing of all my home cooking recipes that I would like to share with the world. Mind you I'm not including the majority - just the <em>usually</em> good ones.</p>

        <!--Here I wanted to have a desciption list, but with bullet points. As I am not using CSS this is interesting challenge. Instead of attempting to inclose dl with ul and each dt and dd with li, I found a solution of using br element to line break after each li and just do a ul list with line breaks. Could also have each li have another ul nested in it to get that tab underneath but hmmm. Seems like more work. To get the tab and the line break instead of doing any of this, I am going to use a <pre></pre> to surround each line item's text (nested in each li) instead of using a <br>, as pre will output contained text with the same spacing and line breaks as it is entered into html. I am just doing this all as an experiment. Once I learn CSS, I will just use CSS for this sort of thing as I believe pre will turn out much more cumbersome and troublesome. For one I do not know whether the bullet point from the ul will be put in front of the first line of text of the li pre or if it will be put in the middle or if there will be one for each line, etc.-->
